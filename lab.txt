Week #4: PYTHON HANDS-ON PRACTICE LAB


Completion time: 45 mins – 1 hour

LAB Assignment: Online Store Management System

LAB Instructions: Use any IDE (VS Code, Pycharm, Replit, etc) to complete the lab.

You are a junior Python developer hired to build a basic command-line Online Store Management App for a small business called 
"ByteBazaar", which sells tech gadgets. The owner wants a minimal but functional app that helps track available products, manage 
purchases, and keep the store's inventory updated in real time.
The system should:
•	Display a list of available products with their prices and quantities in stock.
•	Prompt the customer and allow them to select products to purchase.
•	Calculate the total bill.
•	Handle cases like invalid product input or trying to buy more than what's in stock.
•	Update the inventory after a successful purchase.
•	Allow the process to repeat until the user decides to exit.

The functional requirements are clearly stated below.
You need to build a CLI-based Python app that:
•	Displays the inventory (product name, price, and stock).
•	Prompts the user to select a product to buy (by name).
•	Prompts for quantity to purchase.
•	Validates inputs:
	                    Check if the product exists.
	                    Check if the desired quantity is available.
•	Calculates total cost and displays it.
•	Updates inventory accordingly.
•	Handles exceptions gracefully (e.g., non-numeric input for quantity).
•	Repeats the shopping process until the user decides to quit.

Here is an example of how the application should look. Feel free to add extra design Feel free to add extra design 
elements, features, or enhancements that improve the user experience or functionality.
